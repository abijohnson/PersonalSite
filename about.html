          My name is Abi Johnson and I am a recent graduate from Western Oregon
          University! I majored in Computer Science and really have enjoyed my
          stay at Western. I chose Computer Science because I've always been
          drawn to all things technology ever since I was little. When I was
          gradutating high school, my mom decided to begin her path in getting
          her degree in Computer Science! After being exposed to it a little and
          seeing all the cool things you could do with code, I was hooked. So
          shortly after graduating high school, I started my own CS path!

          Computer Science isn't all I enjoy, I love art and design with a fiery
          passion. This is why I personally like front-end development the most,
          because I can mix these two awesome mediums. I also really enjoy
          cooking, playing video games, cross-stitching, drawing, baking, and
          exploring nature!
